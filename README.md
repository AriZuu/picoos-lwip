lwIP for pico]OS
================

This is a lwIP-based network stack for pico]OS.

Device drivers are included for FreeBSD tap device
and cs8900a chip on Olimex LPC-E2129 board.

There is also [driver for Wifi modules][1] using Broadcom Wiced SDK.

If this network stack is too big for your system, there
is an [alternate one called picoos-net][2], which is based on uIP (ripped off from contiki
distribution).
